# Noita Mod - Twitch Chooses Shield Color

Allows Twitch viewers to redeem a channel point reward that changes your shield color via shifting magical liquid to a set material.

Mod requires:
Config Lib (link: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2287710542)
Twitch Extended (link: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2258441901)

To install just drop the twitch_picks_shield_color folder in your mods folder. Turn on unsafe mods in the Noita mod menu. 

To enable this go into the Config menu, go to Twitch Extended, and the configuration settings will be at the bottom of that tab. 
Create a channel point reward on twitch (input is required for this mod to work). 
Click to link the reward in-game, and then redeem the reward on twitch. 
It should work at this point. 

Colors on by default:
`blood, blue, darkblue, flum, green, grey, lava, lime, mint, orange, pink, player, poo, purple, rainbow, red, scarlet, silver, skyblue, teal, white, yellow`

Disabled by default: (These cause lanterns and creatures that bleed magical liquid (ex. ghosts) to bleed solid material, creating walls.)
`foolsgold, mint`

Any colors can be disabled, and the word typed to trigger than can be customized per word.
